# ⚠️ REAL TRADING WARNING ⚠️

## 🔴 CRITICAL: YOU ARE NOW USING REAL RAYDIUM TRADING

The system has been updated to use **ACTUAL** Raydium DEX integration. This means:

### ✅ What Works Now:
- **Real liquidity pools** from Raydium on Solana
- **Actual on-chain swaps** that execute real trades
- **Real transaction fees** (~0.000005 SOL per transaction + 0.25% swap fee)
- **Real slippage** and price impact
- **Actual profit and loss** from market movements

### 🚨 CRITICAL SAFETY MEASURES:

#### 1. **Network Detection**
- If `SOLANA_RPC_URL` contains "devnet" → **Simulation mode** (safe)
- If mainnet → **REAL TRADES** with real money

#### 2. **Position Size Limits**
- Maximum 30% of balance per trade (hardcoded safety)
- Minimum trade size: 0.001 SOL

#### 3. **Slippage Protection**
- Default: 0.5% slippage tolerance
- Trades will fail if slippage exceeds this

#### 4. **Error Handling**
- If real trade fails → Falls back to simulation
- All errors are logged

## 🎯 How To Use Safely

### **Option A: Test on DEVNET (Recommended First)**
```env
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com
```
- Uses simulated trades (no real money)
- Perfect for testing the system
- Free devnet SOL from faucets

### **Option B: Real Trading on MAINNET**
```env
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
# OR use a premium RPC for better performance
SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://rpc.helius.xyz/?api-key=YOUR_KEY
```

**Before going to mainnet:**
1. ✅ Test thoroughly on devnet
2. ✅ Start with SMALL amounts (0.1-0.5 SOL per agent)
3. ✅ Monitor closely for first 24 hours
4. ✅ Have your CDP wallet properly funded
5. ✅ Understand you can LOSE MONEY

## 📊 Supported Trading Pairs

Currently integrated pools (Mainnet):
- **SOL/USDC** - Most liquid, recommended
- **RAY/USDC** - Raydium token

### Adding More Pools:
Edit `backend/solana/raydium-real.js` and add to the `POOLS` object:
```javascript
'TOKEN-USDC': {
  id: 'pool_id_from_raydium',
  baseMint: 'token_mint_address',
  quoteMint: 'USDC_mint_address',
  lpMint: 'lp_token_mint'
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### What Happens When An Agent Trades:

1. **Decision Made** (by AI)
   - Agent analyzes market data
   - Decides to BUY/SELL/HOLD

2. **Pool Selection**
   - Finds matching Raydium pool
   - Checks liquidity

3. **Amount Calculation**
   - Limits to 30% of balance
   - Calculates with slippage tolerance

4. **Transaction Building**
   - Uses Raydium SDK to build swap instruction
   - Gets token accounts
   - Calculates minimum output amount

5. **Signing**
   - **CDP wallet signs** the transaction
   - This is where your managed keys are used

6. **Execution**
   - Transaction sent to Solana network
   - Waits for confirmation
   - Updates agent balance

7. **Result Tracking**
   - Records profit/loss
   - Updates trade history
   - Posts to Twitter (if enabled)

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### Per Trade Costs:
- **Solana Transaction Fee:** ~0.000005 SOL (~$0.0005)
- **Raydium Swap Fee:** 0.25% of trade amount
- **Slippage:** 0-0.5% (market dependent)
- **AI API Call:** $0.001-0.01 per decision

### Example Trade:
- Trading 0.1 SOL worth:
  - Tx fee: $0.0005
  - Swap fee: 0.00025 SOL (~$0.025)
  - AI cost: ~$0.005

## 🛡️ Safety Checklist

Before enabling real trading:

- [ ] Tested on devnet successfully
- [ ] CDP wallets properly configured
- [ ] Wallet addresses funded with appropriate amounts
- [ ] Using a reliable RPC endpoint (not public free one)
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard is accessible
- [ ] Discord/alerts set up for agent deaths
- [ ] Comfortable with potential losses
- [ ] AI API keys have spending limits set
- [ ] Started with minimal amounts
- [ ] Read all documentation

## 🚨 Emergency Stop

If things go wrong:

```bash
# Stop all servers
Stop-Process -Name node -Force

# Or in the terminal
Ctrl+C
```

The agents will stop trading immediately.

## 📈 Monitoring

### What to Watch:
1. **Agent Balances** - Should not drain too quickly
2. **Success Rate** - Should be >40% for profitability
3. **Slippage** - High slippage = poor liquidity
4. **Gas Fees** - Spikes indicate network congestion
5. **Market Volatility** - Extreme moves can cause losses

### Red Flags:
- ❌ Balance dropping >10% per hour
- ❌ Success rate <30%
- ❌ Repeated failed transactions
- ❌ Agents dying within minutes
- ❌ Unusual wallet activity

## 🎓 Best Practices

1. **Start Small**
   - Fund each agent with 0.1-0.5 SOL max initially
   - Scale up only after 24+ hours of successful operation

2. **Use Quality RPC**
   - Public RPCs are slow and unreliable
   - Consider Helius, QuickNode, or Triton

3. **Monitor Actively**
   - Check dashboard every few hours
   - Set up alerts for agent deaths

4. **Adjust Personalities**
   - Tune risk tolerance based on performance
   - Conservative Carl should always survive longest

5. **Track Performance**
   - Keep logs of all trades
   - Calculate actual ROI
   - Compare agent strategies

## 🔬 Testing Recommendations

### Phase 1: Devnet (1-2 days)
- Test all agent personalities
- Verify trades execute
- Check balance updates
- Test failure scenarios

### Phase 2: Mainnet Micro (1 week)
- 0.1 SOL per agent
- Monitor closely
- Tune parameters
- Fix any issues

### Phase 3: Mainnet Small (2+ weeks)
- 0.5-1 SOL per agent
- Less frequent monitoring
- Evaluate ROI
- Consider scaling

### Phase 4: Production
- Scale based on comfort level
- Never risk more than you can afford to lose
- Consider this entertainment/education spending
